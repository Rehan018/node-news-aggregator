
# News Aggregator Backend Project

## Project Overview

The News Aggregator Backend Project is aimed at developing a RESTful API for a news aggregator system. The system gathers news articles from various sources and presents them in a personalized feed for users. The API provides features such as keyword filtering and sentiment analysis to tailor the news feed based on user preferences.

## Technologies Used

### Backend Technologies

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime that allows the execution of JavaScript code server-side.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building robust APIs.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used for storing user data, news articles, and other relevant information.
- **Mongoose:** An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

### News Data Integration

- **NewsAPI:** An external API used to fetch real-time news articles from various sources.

### Natural Language Processing

- **Natural:** A natural language processing library for Node.js used for stemming words in the keyword extraction process.

### User Authentication and Authorization

- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** Used for secure communication between the client and server, ensuring the integrity of the data exchanged.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure, with different components handling specific functionalities.

- **Controllers:**
  - `UserController.js`: Handles user-related operations (e.g., registration, login).
  - `NewsController.js`: Manages news-related operations, including fetching news based on keywords.

- **Middleware:**
  - `authenticationMiddleware.js`: Verifies JWT tokens for user authentication.
  - `errorHandlingMiddleware.js`: Catches and handles errors globally in the application.

- **Models:**
  - `User.js`: Defines the user schema for MongoDB.
  - `NewsArticle.js`: Defines the news article schema for MongoDB.

- **Routes:**
  - `userRoutes.js`: Defines routes related to user operations.
  - `newsRoutes.js`: Defines routes related to news operations.

- **Services:**
  - `UserService.js`: Contains business logic related to user operations.
  - `NewsService.js`: Contains business logic related to news operations.
  - `SentimentService.js`: Handles sentiment analysis for news articles.

- **Utilities:**
  - `newsApiHandler.js`: Fetches news data from the external NewsAPI.
  - `keywordExtractor.js`: Extracts keywords from news articles using natural language processing.

- **Configuration:**
  - `app.js`: Initializes and configures the Express application.

## Implementation Details

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users register with the system using a unique email and password combination.
   - Passwords are securely hashed before storage in the database.
   - JWT tokens are generated upon successful login and used for subsequent authentication.

2. **News Data Integration:**
   - The `NewsApiHandler` fetches news articles from the external NewsAPI using the provided API key.
   - The fetched data is processed and stored in the MongoDB database using the `NewsService`.

3. **Keyword Filtering:**
   - The `KeywordExtractor` uses natural language processing to extract keywords from news articles.
   - Users can specify preferred keywords, and the system filters news articles based on these preferences.

4. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - The `SentimentService` analyzes the sentiment of news articles.
   - The sentiment score is stored in the `NewsArticle` model, allowing for personalized news feeds based on sentiment preferences.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - The `errorHandlingMiddleware` centrally handles errors, providing consistent error responses to clients.
   - Specific error messages are logged for debugging purposes.

6. **Testing:**
   - Unit tests are implemented using testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha for critical components such as controllers, services, and utilities.
   - Integration tests ensure that different parts of the system work seamlessly together.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Integration with External APIs:**
   - Handling rate limits, API key management, and potential downtimes when integrating with external APIs.

2. **Security:**
   - Ensuring secure password storage through proper hashing and salt techniques.
   - Implementing secure communication using HTTPS and validating user input to prevent injection attacks.

3. **Data Modeling:**
   - Designing effective MongoDB schemas to store user data, news articles, and sentiment information.

4. **Natural Language Processing:**
   - Fine-tuning the keyword extraction process to improve the relevance of extracted keywords.

5. **User Experience:**
   - Balancing the need for personalized news feeds with the potential for creating echo chambers or filter bubbles.

6. **Scalability:**
   - Ensuring that the system can handle a growing number of users and a large volume of news articles.

## Future Enhancements

1. **User Profiles:**
   - Implementing user profiles with additional preferences and customization options.

2. **Notification System:**
   - Introducing a notification system to alert users about breaking news or articles matching their preferences.

3. **Enhanced Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Improving sentiment analysis algorithms for more accurate assessments of article sentiment.

4. **Content Categorization:**
   - Implementing content categorization to group news articles into topics and provide a more structured user experience.
